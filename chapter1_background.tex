\chapter{Background}
The domain of complex board games such as Go, chess, checkers, Othello, and backgammon has been widely regarded as an ideal testing ground for exploring a variety of concepts and approaches in artificial intelligence and machine learning. TD-Gammon  of Tesauro \cite{DBLP:conf/icml/Tesauro92,DBLP:journals/ai/Tesauro02} had demonstrated the impressive ability of machine learning techniques to learn to play games. TD-Gammon used reinforcement learning techniques with a Neural Network (NN) that trains itself to be an evaluation function for the game of backgammon, by playing against itself and learning from the outcome \cite{DBLP:journals/ai/Tesauro02}. eXtreme Gammon \cite{exg}, Snowie \cite{snowie}, and GNUBG \cite{gnubg} are some of the strongest backgammon programs that use Neural Networks; eXtreme Gammon is currently the supreme software \cite{MichaelDepreliStudy2012}. Different variants of backgammon\cite{DBLP:conf/evoW/PapahristouR11,DBLP:conf/ifip12/PapahristouR12}, training techniques, learning methods and neural network architectures have been the focus of some researches that followed the work of Tesauro. This project will focus on studying the effect of including hybrid of Backgammon strategies to the learning network and comparing it to including the strategies separately; the introduction of those strategies will be part of the NN architecture. Many studies do not include the doubling cube in their analyses. As an extension to this project, further analyses with doubling cube will be added.
